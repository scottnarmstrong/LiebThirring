# The Pauli occupation bound

The double coordinate projection is unchanged by exchanging its input coordinates. This holds on
every state and for every one-particle vector.

Pauli occupation: the occupation of any spatial-and-spin one-particle vector is at most one in
an antisymmetric state, with the state norm kept explicit.
